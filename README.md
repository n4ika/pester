**Pester** is your personal productivity gatekeeper — a hybrid to-do list and AI chatbot that helps you stay accountable (and occasionally roasts you into action). At the heart of it all is **Orrin**, your moody, mode-shifting AI sidekick. Built for solo use, Pester combines task tracking with GPT-4o to enforce completion through tone-based chat interactions.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Pester isn’t just a productivity tool — it’s accountability with a personality. Powered by GPT-4o, **Orrin** adapts to your working style: gently encouraging in Support Mode or blunt and sarcastic in Savage Mode. Either way, you're getting your tasks done — one way or another.

> No team mode. No distractions.
